%% Character sheets live in this directory.  This file doubles as a
%% latex'able example charsheet.
%%
%% _template.tex serves as a bare-bones template suitable for
%% copying when starting a new sheet.
%%
%% Character macros (in ../Lists/char-LIST.tex, presumably) each
%% have a file that lives here.  The argument to \name{...} probably
%% should be the macro for the given character, which will generate
%% the charsheet's name (and print out lists of the characters stuff
%% at the end) as specified in char-LIST.tex.  However, you can also
%% just use \name{Some Text} if you want.

%% Using a Char macro with an empty argument, like \cTest{}, will
%% produce the \usual namemapping (see Extras/README-namemappings).
%% Introduce a character with \intro, e.g. \cTest{\intro}, to get a
%% more full name.  \intro can be used whenever it fits into the text

%% The itemz environment is a list environment similar to itemize.
%% The typesetting is very tight, and matches that used by the lists
%% at the end of character sheets.  It takes an optional argument that
%% acts as a title for the list.  The enum environment is a similar
%% variation of the enumerate environment, and the desc environment is
%% similar to description.
\begin{itemz}[Goals]
  \item Ensure the safety of the politicians, and the technical world in general.
  \item Inventory the remaining supplies and ensure the resources needed to save the world are present.
  \item Find a cure for your trances.
  \item Ensure no one finds out about your trances.
  \item Make the mob exchange with \cServant{\informal}.
  \item Make the mob drug exchange with the whole group.
  \item Get enough money to send back to your family at home.
