\name{\cRogueTwo{}}

"Rogue," they call you. That's what they call all of the members of your world's top security team. Little do they know that the original meaning of "rogue"-- "scoundrel"-- fits you just as well. 

It's not that you're a bad person. But there's nothing more thrilling than holding a bar of someone else's gold, pocketing someone else's private letter. You steal from your friends, you steal from your enemies. You're not trying to hurt any particular person or accomplish any specific goal. It's not even about the money. It's the adrenaline. Sure, you've tried alcohol, drugs, all the usual vices, but even your high-stress job as a "Rogue"-- the job that's landed you in too many firefights to count-- can rarely match the rush of stealing. Fortunately, your professional work actually enables your obsession, from time to time. Your job, after all, frequently calls for you to scout important locations, to guard expensive treasures. So what if you pilfer a coin or an international treaty?

Well, your capers are finally catching up to you. During one of your most recent assignments, you were charged with guarding the Countess of Tetra, who happens to own the renowned Ruby Diadem. You weren't greedy, of course; you wanted to extract just one ruby as a souvenir, but you got caught opening the Countess' vault. In the Countess' bedroom. You got caught by the Count.

Now, the Count and Countess are threatening to turn you in as soon as you return from this mission, unless you cough up enough money to placate them. You have some money saved up from previous heists, but you'd better scrounge up another 500 gold pieces right now, if you want to avoid life in prison. Thankfully, this is a pretty interesting mission as they go; you have to accompany some mages, nobles and paladins into a parallel universe, assist them while they're there, and get them safely out again. You don't get all the theory behind it, but you know one thing for sure-- you can dig up loot during this job. There's got to be exotic trinkets in the parallel world, and people from your own side will be bringing over plenty of fancy equipment, rare ingredients and, if you're lucky, gold. Hopefully, you can scrounge up enough actual cash-- merchandise won't do for the Count and Countess-- before this mission's over. You'll have to take risks, but a one-night stealing spree, a thieving tour de force, is the only way to save your skin.

Face it, you haven't been this excited in years.

You can already see a few obstacles in your way. \cNobleOne, the Secretary of Defense, is coming along, and he might have a grudge against you. He's one of those airheads with no magical ability, a fact that would have condemned him to death as an infant if his last name was any less illustrious. Much of your family works at identifying magic-less infants and, well, eliminating them. Though the family business used to make you squeamish, you adore your relatives-- the parents who sacrificed to get you kids the best tutors, the sister who might become a famous mage someday-- and you're desperate to spare them all the shame of your kleptomania. On the other hand, you wouldn't be surprised if \cNobleOne is brusque with you, given what your relations do for a living. Try and keep the powerless twit happy, won't you? 

\cRogueOne, the other Rogue assigned to this mission, also makes you nervous. He's a tad sentimental for your tastes, and, more problematically, he's been giving you weird looks for a while now. Did he see you stealing, somewhere along the way? Nah, he would have turned you in already, and-- the Diadem incident notwithstanding-- you're fantastic at covering your tracks. But you'd better be careful. If you do get caught tonight, make sure you have a good cover story.

Stealing isn't the same as it used to be . . . It's better. And during some recent thefts, you've had weird moments of insight, perceptions about magic and reality that are normally way out of your pay grade.  Now, you have 4 hours to save yourself, doing what you do best. Go rogue.
