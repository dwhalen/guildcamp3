Itâ€™s getting hard to count up your crimes. Fifteen counts of corruption, three counts of accessory to drug trafficking, six counts of plagiarism, ten counts of general academic dishonesty, roughly seventy counts of criminal inaction . . . According to your estimate, the courts would assign you five life sentences or 300 years, whichever one finishes later.

How did things get so bad?

You were approached thirteen years ago, when you were still in university, by a politician who endorsed your project strongly . . . too strongly. You were planning to explore Compound AZ, which showed promise as a lightweight adhesive, but, as the politician sneakily informed you, Compound AZ was also a potent hallucinogen, prized by the criminal classes. In hopes of securing a steady supply, mob bosses needed you to legitimize the stuff and find a commercial purpose for it, and they'd provide you with funding, connections and research hints in return. What could go wrong? Nothing! Unless your hypothesis was wrong. When you discovered that Compound AZ couldn't actually function as a building material, the mob forced you to fudge the results. That's where your troubles started.

By now, the mob has a lot of dirt on you (cough, cough, five life sentences). They will cut you loose and expose you without much risk to themselves, unless you do exactly as they direct. You research what they tell you to research, you report the results that they want. You fundamentally understand science, luckily, and you've veiled your projects with enough hedging and "confounding factors" that other academics haven't caught on. 

In the last few years, though, your position has gotten riskier than ever. Somehow, one of your mob connections passed you preliminary notes from another scientist, \cSciTwo{}, that predicted the current cosmological catastrophe. You cleaned up the notes and developed the ideas with your own perspective, and, at a biophysics conference at the capital city, you gave a presentation foretelling an apocalyptic disaster. You got great feedback, and politicians offered you two times as much funding as you had asked for. Meanwhile, \cSciTwo{} received no interest at all, when \cSciTwo{\they} presented \cSciTwo{\their} original ideas a few days later at a conference in Tetra.

Now, you're in charge of all the scientific research on this catastrophe. The initial work was exciting-- cutting-edge equipment, handsome speaking fees, jet-setting off to conferences and top-secret meetings. But the tension's been building since you realized that \cSciTwo{} was right-- that there really was a snarl in space-time, and that you had set yourself up as the clearest candidate to save your world. As a result, you have to enter an alternate universe, and you're scared to find what's on the other side. You might not make it back . . .

But you can't even linger on your existential despair! Somehow, \cSciTwo{} got assigned as the other scientist on the field research team, and, though \cSciTwo{\they}'s supposed to be brilliant, you really can't stand \cSciTwo{\them}. \cSciTwo{\they}'s downright terrible to have in the lab-- awkward, unhelpful, and self-absorbed. For years you've heard the whispers that \cSciTwo{\they}'s hard to work with; if \cSciTwo{\they} treated the audience at the Tetra conference the way \cSciTwo{\they} treats you, you're not surprised that nobody listened to \cSciTwo{\their} theory. \cSciTwo{\Their} behavior distracts you constantly.

Another problem's been gnawing at you, too . . . \cSciTwo{\they} might suspect you of stealing \cSciTwo{\their} work. You'd better impress \cSciTwo{\them} today, prove your worth as a scientist, and make \cSciTwo{\them} believe that you could have come up with the disaster theory on your own.

To make things even more complicated, \cSpecOpOne{\intro}-- your father-- is assigned to this job for security work, and the two of you haven't been talking recently. About a year ago, \cSpecOpOne{\they} accused you of shutting \cSpecOpOne{\them} out of your life, and \cSpecOpOne{\they} was right; you've been tense and secretive as the pressure from this project ramped up. At the end of the day, though, you need to restore your relationship. Just hearing that \cSpecOpOne{\they} still loves you would make all your stress-- or at least some of it-- melt away. Unfortunately, your criminal activities complicate the situation. \cSpecOpOne{} is an ex-con with a history of illegal human experimentation, the thought of which just makes you sick. But \cSpecOpOne{\they} got clean, and now nothing would hurt \cSpecOpOne{\them} more than realizing that you've fallen into an even shadier lifestyle. Whatever you do, you can't let \cSpecOpOne{\them} find out about your crimes.

And as if all this wasn't messy enough, the mob has devised another assignment for you. According to a message they somehow got from the parallel world, this other universe contains some novel drug, and the mob wants you to retrieve a sample for further research. There also seems to be a parallel mob in the alternate world . . . Some things never change. If you're lucky, you can meet with some of the parallel mob's members and arrange a deal for the drugs, or you can finagle some other way to get the stuff. You smuggled in a sample of your old friend, Compound AZ, that can function as leverage for bargaining. There's also at least one other member of the mob on your team-- \cSpecOpTwo{\intro}-- and \cSpecOpTwo{\they} can help you, with any luck. You have no clue what the alternate world's drug looks like or where it is, but you'd better find it-- otherwise, Terra's mob might cut you loose tomorrow morning.

So you've got to save the world, make a drug deal, fix your family, and keep your dubious past under wraps. Anything else? Oh, right. Make it out alive.

\emph{Five minutes after entering the portal:}
You don't know why, but the portal's malfunctioned. Everyone on your team is still alive, sure, but bits of the research base where you set up the portal followed you into the alternate universe. Though \cSciOne{} has a smirk plastered on \cSciOne{\their} face, you don't have time to worry. Two realities just collided.

\begin{itemz}[Goals]
  \item Get the alternate world's drug
  \item Convince \cSciTwo{} of your scientific ability and your innocence
  \item Find a way to save Terra
  \item Craft new technology as needed within the convergence
  \item Get verbal confirmation from \cSpecOpOne{} that \cSpecOpOne{\they} still loves you.
\end{itemz}

\begin{itemz}[Notes]
	\item You start the game with 10 gold.
