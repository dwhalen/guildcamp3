How did it get so far?

You were approached thirteen years ago, when you were still in university, by a politician who obtained a grant for you by pushing strongly. Too strongly. You were planning to explore commercial uses for Compound 9, which showed promise as a lightweight alternative to cement. Little did you know that Compound 9 was already making the rounds in the shadowy underworld. Dealers were touting it as a potent hallucinogen, while mob bosses wanted the government to sanction its creation for legal purposes, in order to secure a steady supply. They wanted your research to legitimize Compound 9, and they'd provide you funding and connections in return. You were fine with receiving help from the mob-connected politician-- after all, the scientific world is highly competitive, and, as a novice researcher, you were grateful for the leg-up. Unfortunately, your research showed that Compound 9 couldn't actually function as a building material. The mob forced you to fudge your results, and that's where the troubles started.

By now, the mob has too much dirt on you. They will cut you loose and expose you without much risk to themselves, unless you do exactly as they direct. You research what they tell you to research, you report the results that they want. You fundamentally understand science, though, and you've veiled your projects with enough hedging and "confounding factors" that other academics haven't caught on. In the last few years, your position has gotten riskier than ever. Somehow, one of your mob connections passed you preliminary notes from another scientist, \cSciTwo{}, that predicted the current cosmological catastrophe. You cleaned up the notes and developed the ideas with your own perspective, and, at a biophysics conference at the capital city, you gave a presentation foretelling an apocalyptic disaster. You got great feedback, and politicians offered you two times as much funding for further research as you had asked for. Meanwhile, \cSciTwo{} received no interest at all, when \cSciTwo{\they} presented \cSciTwo{\their} original ideas a few days later at a conference in Tetra.

Now, you're in charge of all the scientific research on this catastrophe. The initial work was exciting-- cutting-edge equipment, handsome speaking fees, jet-setting off to conferences and top-secret meetings. But the tension's been building since you realized that \cSciTwo{} was right-- that there really was a snarl in space-time, and that you had set yourself up as the clearest candidate to save the world. As a result, you have to enter an alternate universe, and you're scared to find what's on the other side. Hopefully, you can really do this...

But you can't even linger on your existential despair! Somehow, \cSciTwo{} got assigned as the other scientist on the field research team, and, though \cSciTwo{\they} is supposed to be smart, you really don't like \cSciTwo{\them}. \cSciTwo{\they}'s downright terrible to have in the lab-- awkward, unhelpful, and self-absorbed. For years you've heard the whispers that \cSciTwo{\they}'s hard to work with; if \cSciTwo{\they} treated the audience at the Tetra conference the way \cSciTwo{\they} treats you, you're not surprised that nobody listened to \cSciTwo{\their} theory. \cSciTwo{\Their} presence distracts you constantly.

Another doubt's been gnawing at you, too. What if \cSciTwo{\they} suspects you of stealing \cSciTwo{\their} work? You'd better really impress \cSciTwo{\them} today, prove your worth as a scientist, and make \cSciTwo{\them} believe that you could have come up with the convergence theory on your own.

To make things more complicated, \cSpecOpOne{\intro}-- your parent-- is assigned to this job for security purposes. The two of you haven't been talking recently. About a year ago, \cSpecOpOne{\they} accused you of shutting \cSpecOpOne{\them} out of your life, and \cSpecOpOne{\they} was right; you've been way too tense and secretive as pressure from this project ramped up. At the end of the day, though, you need to restore your relationship. Just hearing that \cSpecOpOne{\they} still loves you would make all your stress-- or at least some of it-- melt away. Unfortunately, your criminal activities complicate the situation. \cSpecOpOne{} is an ex-con with a history of illegal human experimentation, the thought of which just makes you sick. But \cSpecOpOne{\they} got clean, and now nothing would hurt \cSpecOpOne{\them} more than realizing that you've fallen into an even shadier lifestyle. Whatever you do, you can't let \cSpecOpOne{\them} find out about your crimes.

As if this wasn't all messy enough, the mob has another demand for you. According to a message they somehow got from the parallel world, this other universe contains some substance similar to Compound 9-- also a hallucinogen, but more likely to have legitimate uses. The mob wants you to find and retrieve a large sample. They also apparently provided you with a sample you can trade them with. Unfortunately in the combination of worlds this seems to have gotten a bit messy - you aren't sure where the box is now... Luckily, there's at least one other member of the mob on your team-- \cSpecOpTwo{\intro}-- and \cSpecOpTwo{\they}'s likely to help you. There also seems to be a parallel mob in the alternate world . . . Some things never change. If you're lucky, you can meet with some of the parallel mob's members and arrange a deal for the drugs, or you can finagle some other way to get the stuff. If you're unlucky, your mob might cut you loose tomorrow morning.

So you've got to save the world, make a drug deal, fix your family, and keep your dubious past under wraps. Anything else? Oh, right. Make it out alive.

\emph{Five minutes after entering the portal:}
You don't know how, but the portal seems to have malfunctioned. Everyone on your team is still alive, sure, but bits of the research base where you set up the portal followed you into the alternate universe. \cSciOne{} has a smirk plastered on \cSciOne{\their} face, but you don't have time to worry. Two realities  just collided.

\begin{itemz}[Goals]
  \item Get alternate version of Compound 9
  \item Convince \cSciTwo{} of your ability and innocence
  \item Research the convergence
  \item Craft new technology as needed within the convergence
  \item Get verbal confirmation from \cSpecOpOne{} that \cSpecOpOne{\they} still loves you.
\end{itemz}
