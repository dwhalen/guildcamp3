\bigquote{``Love can sometimes be magic. But magic can sometimes... just be an illusion.''}{-- Javan}

You have spent many long years studying the arcane forces of your world. Your family supported your studies with a cold distance. You are a third born, not expected to take on the family's noble mantle ever, you are not trained in the intricacies of the noble etiquette instead being not so subtly directed to study either the high arcane or the high divine. In your case you dove into the lore of the magical to the exclusion of all else. Your time pouring over books and scrolls have left you with a lack of social grace and a lack of any friends with whom to share your discoveries, your times happy and sad. 

Still you are master of your craft with few that can rival your grasp of the weave of reality the sings to you. Your excellence was noticed by the research department of \bMagicWorld{} and you were brought in as a researcher that quickly rose through the ranks due to pure skill alone, no nepotism or politicking involved to be sure. Even as you rose there has been someone always there, \cMageTwo{\intro}. You have known \cMageTwo{\them} since you both began your arcane training, and since then there was a sense of competition. Over time this sense has grown, with their amazing grasp of the weave being increasingly frustrating. You know that you are the better mage, despite \cMageTwo{\them} being there with \cMageTwo{\their} own advances and discoveries. You want to show everyone that you, you alone, are the best, not \cMageTwo{\them}. The best way to do this is to get your name on the department publishing board used to record the achievements of the mages. 

Recently you have come to know a dark secret that is befalling your world: the weave is becoming unstable, which will lead to the end of your world. While working here you have met someone who has, dare you even think it, stolen your heart, \cNobleOne{\intro}. one of your superiors who you have barely gotten to know, but who has nonetheless left to shivering with nerves, and with the world perhaps coming to a close you have decided to put your hesitation to and end and craft a proposal ring and confess your love of \cNobleOne{\informal}. If only you could spend the rest of your life with \cNobleOne{\them} that would make you so happy. 

Thankfully, your department has been able to detect a stabilizing force in another place, a place outside this world, outside of conventional travel. While many have thought of alternate universes being out there, you have helped to create a method of taking that theory and making it a reality. There are somethings on the other side that should be of use for stabilizing the weave, at least that is what your rituals have been able to divine. You have been able to open small transient portals, enough to see that this other world is not inhospitable and that the air is breathable. Though you have seen glimpses of the oddest sort of buildings, a shiny gray and glass. You wonder what forms of magic there are in this land, perhaps different techniques are used on the other side, so exciting this is.

Your rituals have narrowed down the location of the artifacts you need, and your overseers have decided that a massive form of the ritual must be enacted. Under the watch of your superior \cNobleOne{\intro} and base security, the ritual was put into motion, with the rather unwanted help of \cMageTwo{}. There was a flash a sense of wrongness and a taste of red, there are a number of other people in strange attire, one looks so strangely like your twin, and the walls, they are no longer just the simple stone you are used to but a mix of stone and metal, and your ritual station now has an odd metal mirror of itself on the other side of the room. The ritual seems to have taken the your base and blended it with a base on the other side. The world is one parallel to yours to the point that there are even doubles of yourselves there. It seems their side mirrors your situation and they attempted to come to your side seeking three artifacts that you know are on base somewhere. You and your rival will need to work with these newcomers to create something to analyze the artifacts in question to see how they can stabilize the worlds. 

Of course any plans will need to be signed off on by \cNobleOne{\intro} before any building is allowed, bureaucracy at its finest. Also fortunate is that while the rest of both worlds are cut off at the moment, \cPaladin{} is here, meaning your mana will be able to be recharged, thank the gods. As you see your double and think to yourself that maybe they will be someone you can finally relate to, maybe even actually call friend, after all who would be a better friend than yourself?
