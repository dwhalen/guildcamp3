You cannot believe they put a pacifist in the position of secretary of defense. \cPoliOne{\intro} did not even serve in the armed forces. Another sign that this great country is losing its edge. Everybody thinks that we have finally achieved the peace of our time. But you know it wouldn't last, which is why as the Under Secretary of Defense you have pushed for and overseen the \emph{Sky Net}, a network of defense satellites covering the near earth space against relativistic missile attacks. It is your life's work, and you sleep well knowing that none can sneak up on your beloved homeland. Perhaps this \emph{is} the peace of your time. 

You should have known better. For a year now, you've been receiving credible reports of paranormal incidents. The scale has been increasing exponentially until just short of natural disasters. Possibilities of foreign sabotage was quickly ruled out because the incidents were affecting all major players. It sickened you to see \emph{Sky Net} turn into distant fireworks due to malfunctioning navigational systems. It is going to be near impossible to get funding for it again, especially with \cPoliOne{} against your idea of military spending. However, if \cPoliOne{} were somehow out of the picture \ldots  After all, it would do this country a great service to put a real general in charge of her defense.

While the world is falling apart around us, the Secretary-General formed a high priority task force to solve this issue. Scientists scrambled to find an explanation while spec-op's procured info and equipment that is otherwise unavailable. A pair of researchers formerly working on multiverse theory claim that our world is feeling the tidal effects of a another universe drifting too close to us. The eventual passing in the 5th dimension will tear us apart, unless we tunnel to them via a \emph{portal} first and retrieve several key artifacts. You are giving them the benefit of the doubt for now, because their demo of a partial portal was very impressive. Besides, other worlds full of people and resources? It is just too much of an opportunity as well as security risk to overlook. 

Scientists estimate they can fully open the portal four hours before the eventual passing, and the fate of the world rests on the success of the spec-op team locating and retrieving all artifacts in time. It will supposedly make the two worlds diverge enough for both to survive. It is therefore imperative that you keep your people in line and on track. \cPoliOne{} might be a stickler for rules and meetings, but you agree they are necessary in this case, as it is too easy to lose track of time and squander the remaining hours. The scientists are required to come up with a sound plan of action depending on the portal condition, to be signed by you and \cPoliOne{}, within the hour of the portal opening. You will also lead all hands mission update with \cPoliOne{} at an hour in, and an hour before the end. 

When the portal opened though, something went awry. There was a flash, a sense of wrongness and a taste of red, and your surrounding was somewhat \ldots transformed. Instead of clean and efficient design of a modern military base, it is in certain places decorated like a museum piece of a renaissance era living room. What's more, random people appeared out of nowhere. But they are not entirely random. They look just like members on your team. You even spotted yourself in medieval clothing, and you cut quite a figure even in those antiquated uniforms. If you are not hallucinating, this must have something to do with the parallel universe. Perhaps they never had industrial revolution? You also see the double of the weapon trafficker that you court-martialed, and oversaw the execution of, but \cRogueOne{they} is not your problem, instead your doppelganger's. After all you doubt they are much different from the weapon trafficker you caught during the war. \cRogueOne{intro} hoarded spare weapon parts and smuggled them back home to supply the mobsters. The mobster scene got so out of hand that the national guard had to be called. You only caught \cRogueOne{} towards the end of the war because supplies were running low and \cRogueOne{}'s unit kept running out of spare parts. You personally chaired \cRogueOne{}'s court martial, and watched \cRogueOne{their} execution with great satisfaction.

The worst thing is that most of the equipment is malfunctioning. You believe this is the effect of the other universe you are seeing. The scientists will be too busy with our primary objectives of saving the world, but you know a thing or two about science, and it wouldn't hurt to try getting some of the equipment working again. After all, you don't want to be caught defenseless should these doppelgangers turn hostile.

With great perils come great opportunity. Perhaps it is your chance to make a move against \cPoliOne{} as well as saving the world. If you succeed, you will have all the clout you need to implement the mighty defense infrastructures you have thought up over the years.
