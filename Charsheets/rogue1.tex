%% Character macros (in ../Lists/char-LIST.tex, presumably) each

%% should be the macro for the given character, which will generate

\name{\cRogueOne{}}




Outline:

Lower middle class, grew up lonely, always had trouble with relationships. Sister he was close to in childhood was murdered, never found her killer.

Found solace in practicing fighting skills in back alleys and skulking around the city as a teen, conflicted, looking for meaning, figuring out things on his own

Recruited by the local Rogue's guild and eventually worked his way up to being noticed for his skill and had his services specifically requested for a secret convocation project

Just when his life has gotten better to some degree, though he is still lonely, here's the end of the world to bring things down. Like hell is he going to let this stop him. The apocalypse isn't going to stop him now, just when better things are within reach. 

Hopefully he will be able to find this in the magic world and help to save it, but if worst comes to worst, Ultimately is willing to go his own way and burn bridges if it will give him a chance for a better life. Can't get overly attached

Having spent a lot of time around the base, he's studied enough of the magical texts and items to know that he could probably use it to create a one-way escape vehicle to yet another world if worse comes to worst. Probably should make it just in case

Paladin recently arrived for the portal opening. Get spiritual guidance

Everything combined. This wasn't what you expected

Follow orders --> reconnaissance and item retrieval

Find love and propose. Hey, why not? It's the end of the world, and your backup plan might not work. You have your eye on \cPoliOne{}

No double... but why? You must find out.

%% The itemz environment is a list environment similar to itemize.
%% The typesetting is very tight, and matches that used by the lists
%% at the end of character sheets.  It takes an optional argument that
%% acts as a title for the list.  The enum environment is a similar
%% variation of the enumerate environment, and the desc environment is
%% similar to description.
\begin{itemz}[Goals]
  \item Things to do
  \item Governments to topple
  \item Worlds to dominate
\end{itemz}

\begin{itemz}[Notes]
  \item You were born in London.
  \item You went to MIT, and never left.
\end{itemz}

%% List contacts, using \contact{<char macro>}
\begin{contacts}
  \contact{\cNobleOne{}} Secretariat of Defense. He has no magical ability. In your opinion, he doesn't deserve the powerful role he has, despite his noble bloodline. However, you are subject to his orders and will do so grudgingly to save your world.
  \contact{\cNobleTwo{}} The Undersecretariat of Arcane Scholarship. 
  \contact{\cMageOne{}} A mage who helped to create the portal to the other universe. You don't know \cMageOne{\them}.
  \contact{\cMageTwo{}} A mage who helped to create the portal to the other universe. You don't know \cMageTwo{\them}.
  \contact{\cRogueTwo{}} A member of base security. He runs the black market. Shifty fellow.
  \contact{\cPaladin{}} Representative of the Church. You'll probably visit him at least once to recharge your mana or offer a prayer to the gods.
  \contact{\cServant{}} A \cServant{\human} who follows \cNobleOne{} around. Probably his servant, based on his clothing and manner. 
\end{contacts}
