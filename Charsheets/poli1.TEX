Your made your career by managing crisis and being on the winning side. Your proudest achievement was the peace signing between warring members of the United Governments.  

But it wasn't all smooth sailing as the public was lead to perceive. You have witnessed humanitarian disasters, put up with negotiating with war criminals, and everyone on your team has had to make great sacrifice, sometimes the ultimate kind, before there could be a happily ever after. At times you wonder if humans are only a step above animals. It only takes unchecked power and greed to revert men into dangerous animals. You turned to religion and secretly sought guidance. You want to know why humanity is tested mercilessly through one crisis after another. You keep it a secret because it is uncommon for a public figure like yourself to openly subscribe to religion. 

In the following decade you've been at the capital navigating the relatively benign waters of partisanal maneuvers. That's not to say it doesn't have its share of back stabbing, but your years on highly volatile diplomatic and intelligence operations have sharpened your survival skills and killer instincts. It is surprising how many of your fellow politicians stick to ships that are clearly sinking. But not you. Your latest break was supporting the current Secretary-General of the United Governments during her election and your appointment as secretary of defense following her inauguration. Ironically your direct subordinate \cPoliTwo{\intro}, the Under Secretary of Defense, is one of those who cling to old schools of thought. \cPoliTwo{\Their} idea of a satellite based defense grid was made obsolete by current generation of starships and hence a complete waste of resources. It's a surprise that \cPoliTwo{they} kept \cPoliTwo{their} office. Oh well, \cPoliTwo{they} works for you now, and \cPoliTwo{they} better get with the game, because we are having the peace of our time.

But it is never that easy. There is always another crisis. For a year now, you've been receiving credible reports of paranormal incidents. The scale has been increasing exponentially until just short of natural disasters. Possibilities of terrorism was quickly ruled out because the incidents were just too bizarre. The Secretary-General formed a classified task force while keeping the news from the public at your insistence. Scientists scrambled to find an explanation while spec-op's procured info and equipment that is otherwise unavailable. A pair of researchers formerly working on multiverse theory claim that our world is feeling the tidal effects of a another universe drifting too close to us. The eventual passing in the 5th dimension will tear us apart, unless we tunnel to them via a \emph{portal} first and retrieve several key artifacts. That sounds like hogwash at first, but you were impressed with what the scientists achieved with a partial portal so far. Besides, it is the best lead by far, and in the nick of time. Scientists estimate they can fully open the portal four hours before the eventual passing, and the fate of the world rests on the success of your team locating and retrieving all artifacts in time. It is therefore imperative that you keep your people in line and on track. The world might be ending, but that doesn't mean everyone should forsake the sociopolitical machinery that works so well. You require the scientists to submit a sound plan of action based on the condition of the portal, to be signed by you and \cPoliTwo{}, within the hour after the portal opens. You will also lead all hands mission updates with \cPoliTwo{} at each hour on the mark. 

When the portal opened though, something went awry. There was a flash, a sense of wrongness and a taste of red. Your surrounding was somewhat \ldots transformed. Instead of clean and efficient modern decor of a secret research facility, it is in certain places decorated like a museum piece of a renaissance era living room. What's more, random people appeared out of nowhere. But they are not entirely random. They look just like members on your team. Wait, there's \cPoliTwo{} and yourself in medieval clothing, they look ridiculous. If you are not dreaming, then this must have something to do with the parallel universe. Perhaps they never had industrial revolution? And \cTech{} is in some sort of religious clothing. Is god common in the multiverse? Is it the same one true god? Perhaps you can find out under the guise of formal investigation. That would be quite a theological break through.

Anyways you still have a world to save, and this is but another crisis in the bigger crisis that you have to manage. After all this is done, perhaps you would run for the Secretary-General's office in next year's election.
