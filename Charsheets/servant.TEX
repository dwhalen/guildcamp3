%% Character sheets live in this directory.  This file doubles as a
%% latex'able example charsheet.
%%
%% _template.tex serves as a bare-bones template suitable for
%% copying when starting a new sheet.
%%
%% Character macros (in ../Lists/char-LIST.tex, presumably) each
%% have a file that lives here.  The argument to \name{...} probably
%% should be the macro for the given character, which will generate
%% the charsheet's name (and print out lists of the characters stuff
%% at the end) as specified in char-LIST.tex.  However, you can also
%% just use \name{Some Text} if you want.

Your first memory is of the flame of mana rushing through you as the animation ritual was performed over your constructed body. Opening your eyes for the first time, you saw your first master, a high-ranking member of the mob.

%% The itemz environment is a list environment similar to itemize.
%% The typesetting is very tight, and matches that used by the lists
%% at the end of character sheets.  It takes an optional argument that
%% acts as a title for the list.  The enum environment is a similar
%% variation of the enumerate environment, and the desc environment is
%% similar to description.
\begin{itemz}[Goals]
  \item Do everything \cNobleOne{} tells you to do
  \item Make sure \cNobleOne{} is successful in \cNobleOne{\their} endeavors
  \item Mob kill
  \item Mob exchange

\begin{itemz}[Notes]
  \item If your mana level ever reaches 0, you will die.

%% List contacts, using \contact{<char macro>}

  \contact{\cPoliOne{}} Your master's double from the other universe, who you must kill to satisfy the mob
