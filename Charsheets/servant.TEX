%%
%% _template.tex serves as a bare-bones template suitable for
%% copying when starting a new sheet.

%% Character macros (in ../Lists/char-LIST.tex, presumably) each
%% have a file that lives here.  The argument to \name{...} probably
%% should be the macro for the given character, which will generate
%% the charsheet's name (and print out lists of the characters stuff
%% at the end) as specified in char-LIST.tex.  However, you can also
%% just use \name{Some Text} if you want.

Your first memory is of the flame of mana rushing through you as the animation ritual was performed over your constructed body. Opening your eyes for the first time, you saw your first master, a high-ranking member of the \bMagicMob{}.

Creation by the mob and intention

Cruel treatment and bindings

"Jobs"

Potions Training

Religion

Assignment to \cNobleOne{} and binding

Coming to loyalty due to kind treatment

First loyalty to master, even if it means he leaves you

Loyalty to the magical world --> necessity of its magic to survive
(low mana --> death)

Solution to the binding?

Mob orders, lower priority

%% The itemz environment is a list environment similar to itemize.
%% The typesetting is very tight, and matches that used by the lists
%% at the end of character sheets.  It takes an optional argument that
%% acts as a title for the list.  The enum environment is a similar
%% variation of the enumerate environment, and the desc environment is
%% similar to description.
\begin{itemz}[Goals]
  \item Do everything \cNobleOne{} tells you to do.
  \item Make sure \cNobleOne{} is successful in \cNobleOne{\their} endeavors.
  \item Work towards the common goal of saving your home universe.
  \item Kill \cPoliOne{}, your master's double from the other universe, in hopes that it will satisfy your binding to kill your master. Don't let anyone catch you.
  \item Deliver the secret documents the Mob has given you to \cSpecOpTwo{}.
  \item Facilitate the exchange of drugs between the Magic Mob and Tech Mob. Don't let anyone not in on the deal get ahold of them.
\end{itemz}

\begin{itemz}[Notes]
  \item If your mana level ever reaches 0, you will die.
  \item Your potions training may be very useful in attaining your goals.
