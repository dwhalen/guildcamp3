\bigquote{``A dream doesn't become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination and hard work.''}{-- Colin Powell}


Your parents tried their best to give you a normal childhood, but you were a sharp kid. You discovered magic the same year you found out that Santa wasn't real. But it was worse. Magic \emph{is} real, and you are the only person who does not have it. In a world ruled by magic, having no magic is punishable by death at birth, even though many commoners' powers are as simple as lighting a candle or summoning a breeze. You, however, are heir to a prominent and powerful family of archmages. Your family's name kept you alive, but you had to find your path on your own. In order to make up for your lack of magic power, the link between mind and matter, you mastered mind and matter in their own right.

When it came time to take over your father's role in the ruling government, you did surprisingly well. The noble hierarchy was formed based on magical prowess a long time ago, but over the centuries it has become much more. Demonstration of personal prowess in court is a thing of the past. Today, money and influence rule. The nobles, while most revered for their might in magic, seldom find use for their talents. On one hand, mind magic is strictly forbidden, and there are amulets to protect unsuspecting victims from such acts of malfeasance. On the other hand, using physical magic is as rude as throwing a punch, and no noble worth their fiefdom would ever be caught doing so in court. The nobles fight with dueling canes. As long as no demonstration is required, and you can discuss magic with the best of them. And you have the best mages to council with. You could almost forget your own lack of magic, but for the constant reminder from your peers.

Your lieutenant, \cNobleTwo{\intro} is very capable but he worries you. \cNobleTwo{They} is from a family with limited influence but this has not limited \cNobleTwo{their} own ambition. \cNobleTwo{} is nominally under your patronage, but \cNobleTwo{they} has no respect for \emph{lesser} beings and has made it clear on many occasions. Sometimes you wonder if \cNobleTwo{} is a sociopath. Perhaps it is only \cNobleTwo{their} obsession with decorum keeping \cNobleTwo{\them} from stabbing you in the back and taking your worldly possessions. Unfortunately you needed someone for administrative magics and \cNobleTwo{} came highly recommended by several sources. 

Your head servant, \cServant{\intro}, on the other hand, is the easily the most trust worthy person you have ever met. Ironically, \cServant{they} is actually a homunculus. It is a secret because a creature of magic does not have the same rights as a flesh and blood person. But you care more about merit than birth. For that, \cServant{} appears to be extra grateful. 

You mansion has a backup heating and ventilation system designed by your grand father that runs not on magic, but water steam. He was a very powerful mage but was also very interested in machinery, especially after his retirement. He spent a lot of that time teaching you action and reaction, leverage and torque. He believed that magic should be servant to humanity rather than his master. Your younger self studied machinery with fervor and found solace in it. You caused quite some commotion when you showed up at a party in your steam powered mobile one day to show that you could manage without magic. It was a childish act looking back now, but sometimes you wonder if there is another world where everything is done with machinery rather than magic. Perhaps \emph{there} people are judged by their virtues rather than their magic abilities.

It is perhaps the reason that you have been funding the research in the multiverse. You've taken it on as a pet project. Little did you know that it will be crucial to saving your world one day. The thing that they call \emph{convergence} now in the tabloids has been known among the nobles for some time. It manifests as of loss of magic that could gradually cover the globe permanently. The mages claim they can avert Armageddon by retrieving certain missing artifacts from the multiverse. That requires implementing a portal that your researchers have theorized. 

Because the portal cannot let too many people through at a time, and you were already in charge of this particular research, the Convocation put you in charge of the most important and desperate mission in human history. You have the most brilliant mages and a pair of elite rogues at your disposal. \cNobleTwo{} might be a problem, but you mustn't show fear or weakness. If that coyote can sense it he will tear you apart. 

They say nobles do whatever they want, but it is largely an illusion. When it comes to other nobles you interact with, you are less free than the commoners. \cNobleTwo{} is case in point. On the other hand there is \cMageOne{\intro}, who is one of the mages studying the parallel universe. Common people only use magic as means to an end. \cMageOne{} loves and understands magic the way you do machinery. You have a feeling that \cMageOne{they} does not care that you cannot cast magic, as long as you can understand and discuss it on an abstract level. However, the chasm in your social status prohibit you from showing too much interest in \cMageOne{}. Perhaps you would at least get to know the person better, because you might not get another chance after today.

The mages can only open the portal when the two worlds are extremely close, namely four hours before \emph{convergence}. It is not much time for such a high stake operation. You want to have hourly all hands meetings, lead by you and \cNobleOne{}, at least for the first two hours. The mages need to have a sound plan before the first meeting for you to approve of and brief everyone with. The Magic Convocation assigned \cPaladin{} to perform hourly services to keep the morale up. You do not personally care for a religion that approves of killing magic-less infants and plan to get smoke breaks during the services.

When the portal opened though, something went awry. There was a flash, a sense of wrongness and a taste of red. Your surrounding was somewhat \ldots transformed. Some of the wood panelings were replaced with smooth materials you have never seen. Some of the boxes have lights blinking on and off, and their hummings are eerily familiar. \emph{Eureka!} They remind you of some of your machines! Clearly these are much more advanced. 

At the same time, random people appeared out of nowhere. But they are not entirely random. They look just like members on your team. The women are scantly dressed, and wait, there's even yourself in some, the uniform is strange looking, but your double is clearly also in charge of things. If you are not dreaming, then this must have something to do with the multi-universe. From what you can gather, these people do not seem to have magic. Instead, they have highly advanced machines.

Now that there is firm evidence that a world can exist without magic, perhaps now people will believe that it is not magic that makes one human, and that the infanticides can finally stop. You don't know \cPaladin{} well, but he is the spiritual counselor of this unprecedented mission. Perhaps he will have an enlightened view, too. You would like to convince him to pardon the magic-less in his scheduled sermons. You must also talk to the mages' counterparts and find out more about their machineries. The ones you have seen can crudely imitate magical effects at best, but in the parallel universe they seem to be used for everything your people do with magic, including opening the portal. 

You believe everything that takes place here today will have lasting influences in your society at large, if the society continues to exist, that is.

  \item Be accepted for your lack of magical abilities.
  \item Get \cPaladin{} to include in his sermon that those who are born without magical powers are not in inferior.
  \item Talk to mage counterparts and learn their technology.

\begin{itemz}[Notes]
	\item During \cPaladin{\formal}'s sermons, you should leave the room. You wouldn't want to listen to the teachings of a church that advocates killing your kind.
