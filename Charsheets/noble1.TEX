\bigquote{``A dream doesn't become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination and hard work.''}{-- Colin Powell}


Your parents tried their best to give you a normal childhood, but you were a sharp kid. You discovered magic the same year you found out that Santa wasn't real. But it was worse. Magic \emph{is} real, and you are the only person you know who does not have it. In a world ruled by magic, having no magic is punishable by death at birth, even though many commoners' powers are as simple as lighting a candle or summoning a breeze. You, fortunately, are heir to a prominent and powerful family of archmages. Your family's name kept you alive, but you had to find your path on your own. In order to make up for your lack of natural magic power, the instinctual link between mind and matter, you thoroughly mastered magical theory. Through unspeakably hard work, you've obtained a rather precarious position as the Undersecretary of Arcane Research.

You've had some extralegal help, though. \bMagicMob{} is a shadowy underworld organization with tendrils everywhere, and you're one of their pet projects. They pulled some strings to make sure you got your title, even though discrimination against magic-less people like you runs deep, and now you must repay their service by manipulating policy. Your relationship with the mob is unfortunately complicated. You've audaciously refused some of their most appalling demands and upset powerful people in the process-- rumor has it that one of the bosses wants you dead. And yet, your head servant, \cServant{\intro}, who is also in the mob, is the easily the kindest companion you could ever ask for. Ironically, \cServant{they} is actually a homunculus, a creature made by magic. It is a secret because no homunculus has the same rights as a flesh-and-blood person. But you care more about merit than birth, and, for that, \cServant{} is grateful and especially loyal to you. 

You and  \cServant{\intro} live in your family mansion. It's a strange place, with a backup heating and ventilation system designed by your grand father that runs not on magic but on water steam. He was a very powerful mage but was also interested in machinery, especially after his retirement. He spent a lot of that time teaching you action and reaction, leverage and torque. To show his love for you, he had helped you craft a beautiful ring from gold-- as spectacular as any magically constructed ring, but made through hard work and metallurgy. When you look at that ring, you sometimes wonder if there is another world where everything is done with machinery rather than magic. Perhaps \emph{there} people would be judged for their virtues, not their magic abilities.

It is perhaps the reason that you started funding the research in the multiverse. It started as a side project, but it now appears to be crucial to saving your world. The disaster that they call \emph{convergence} in the tabloids has been known among the nobles for some time. The mages claim they can avert Armageddon by retrieving certain missing artifacts from the multiverse. That requires implementing a portal that your researchers have theorized. 

Because the portal cannot let too many people through at a time, and you were already in charge of this particular research, the Convocation put you in charge of the most important and desperate mission in human history. You have the most brilliant mages and a pair of elite rogues at your disposal. You're also bringing your servant with you-- the mob's given you a rather unsavory job to carry out in the other world, and they've threatened to expose your previous tampering with policy and land you in prison if you don't succeed. \cServant{\intro} has promised to help you to the best of \cServant{\their} ability.

The circumstances are terrible, of course, but you're glad to have an opportunity to spend time with \cMageOne{\intro}, one of the mages coming with you to the parallel universe. Common people only use magic as means to an end, yet \cMageOne{} loves and understands magic the way you do machinery. And the best part about it is that \cMageOne{they} does not care that you cannot cast magic, as long as you can understand and discuss it on an abstract level. Despite the chasm in your social statuses, you'd like to get to know \cMageOne{\them} better. 

The mages can only open the portal when the two worlds are extremely close, namely four hours before \emph{convergence}. It is not much time for such a high-stake operation. You want to have an all-hands meeting two hours in, to keep everyone informed and on-track. You've told the mages to bring you a sound plan as soon as possible; you'd like to approve it within the first hour. The Magic Convocation assigned \cPaladin{} to perform hourly services to keep the morale up. You do not personally care for a religion that approves of killing magic-less infants and plan to get smoke breaks during the services.

When the portal opened, though, something went awry. There was a flash, a sense of wrongness and a taste of red. Your surrounding was somewhat \ldots transformed. Some of the wood panelings were replaced with smooth synthetic materials you have never seen. At the same time, random people appeared out of nowhere, but they are not entirely random . . . They look just like members on your team. Wait, there's even yourself in some weird-looking uniform, and your double is clearly also in charge of things in the other world. If you are not dreaming, then this must have something to do with the multiverse. From what you can gather, these people do not seem to have magic. Instead, they have highly advanced machines.

Now that there is firm evidence that a world can exist without magic, perhaps now people will believe that it is not magic that makes one human, and that the infanticides should finally stop. You don't know \cPaladin{} well, but he is the spiritual counselor of this unprecedented mission. Perhaps he will have an enlightened view, too. You would like to convince him to pardon the magic-less in his scheduled sermons. You must also talk to the mages' counterparts and find out more about their machineries.

You believe everything that takes place here today will have lasting influences in your society at large, if the society continues to exist, that is.

%% variation of the enumerate environment, and the desc environment is
%% similar to description.
\begin{itemz}[Goals]
  \item Keep your people in line and save the world.
  \item Be accepted for your lack of magical abilities.
  \item Complete the mob's assignment.
  \item Get to know \cMageOne{} better. Maybe even see if you could have dinner with \cMageOne{\them} after this all blows over. 
  \item Get \cPaladin{} to include in his sermon that those who are born without magical powers are not in inferior.
  \item Talk to \bTechWorld{}'s counterparts and learn about their technology.
\end{itemz}

\begin{itemz}[Notes]
	\item During \cPaladin{\formal}'s sermons, you should leave the room, unless you've convinced the paladin to reject the infanticides. You don't want to listen to the teachings of a church that advocates killing your kind. 
	\item You start the game with 50 gold. You also have the ring you made with your grandfather.
\end{itemz}
