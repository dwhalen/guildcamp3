\name{\cNobleTwo{}}

You hail from a long line of servants of the realm, giving talented rule and sound decisions for generations. A part of your family's ancestry also includes ties to a far reaching organization, one heard in fearful whispers, \bMagicMob{}. Have pride in your ancestors and in your self for you are one of the nobility, trained from birth to guide the path of your world's future. You hold the position of Junior Secretariat of Arcane Research, a fairly prestigious positions, that you \emph{earned}, not simply given, though the earning include favors for \bMagicMob{} every so often. Qualified may not be necessarily said of your ranking superior the Secretariat of Defensive Measures \cNobleOne{}, he does not even have magic for gods sakes. In all honesty you are much more qualified for the position, but the only way you can think of making this happen in your lifetime would be if a vote of no confidence could happen in an emergency situation. 

Oddly enough an emergency situation has brewed all on its own. Your position has made you privy to a rather dark secret plagueing your world, the weave is is becoming unstable which would lead to the end of your world if it is not fixed. Fortunately your mages have recently found a possible solution. Two of your top researchers have found signs of something in another universe that could be able to stabilize your world. They have been able to create small temporary portals to this other universe so you, and your superior, gave the go ahead to create a larger portal to send in a team to get the stabilizing artifacts. In addition to this, you were able to send a copy of the minor portal ritual to your criminal connections resulting in cross universe criminal connections being made somehow. You have been given the task of picking up a package of drugs from a member of \bTechMob{} and delivering a similar package to the otherside's member. 



The ritual was initiated, with a flash of lemon, and a feel of sweetness several people appeared and the room has changed. The walls are a blend of the good ole stone and some sort of metal, and your mages ritual areas now have a wierd mirror image on the other side of the room.
