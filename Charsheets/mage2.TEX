\name{\cMageTwo{}}

\bigquote{``Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.''}{-- Arthur C. Clarke}

You are a mage. This is a position that you have earned through long hours, years of study, sacrifice and work. In a world where even the least have the ability to manipulate magic, it take something very special to become a mage. You succeeded despite the world being against you and the odds stacked in favor of the house. Even being dealt a bad hand you have managed to drag yourself up into being one of the top researchers of \bMagicWorld{}. You lost both of your parents early in life, one to the void, and one simply walking out on you. Hard times in your youth did not prevent you from displaying great talent in the manipulation of the fabric of reality. This lead to you being chosen for arcane study. Paid by scholarship, you devoted yourself to proving that you will be the best. Now you find yourself working on a classified base delving into the mysteries of reality. Though throughout your studies you found one person, \cMageOne{\intro}, to always be right there with \cMageOne{\their} own discovery, \cMageOne{\their} own latest master craft. Obviously a spoiled noble brat - \cMageOne{they} have never had to work just to survive and you want to beat \cMageOne{\them} in the way that really matters, publicly, and irrefutably. Normally this would be a simple rivalry, but \cMageOne{} made it personal. You were taking your little sister for a tour of the grounds, you rarely got to see her but she was so proud of your acheivements. You both were walking down a hallway, when there was an explosion, she...she did not make it. It turned out \cMageOne{} had been working on unstable soulgem magic in his personal study, not in the safe ritual rooms that are warded and secured against magic going wrong. \cMageOne{They} has only one goal to be at the top, obviously without caring about the risks or cost. The best way to do get back at them is where it hurts, you need to get your name on the department publishing board used to record the achievements of the mages.

Recently you have come to know a dark secret that is befalling your world. The weave is becoming unstable, which would lead to the end of your world. Thankfully your department has been able to detect a stabilizing force in another place, a place outside this world, outside of conventional travel. While many have thought of alternate universes being out there, you have helped to create a method of taking that theory and making it a reality. There are somethings on the other side that should be of use for stabilizing the weave, at least that is what your rituals have been able to divine. You have been able to open small, transient portals, enough to see that this other world is not inhospitable and the air is breathable. Though you have seen glimpses of the oddest sort of buildings, a shiny gray and glass. You wonder what forms of magic there are in this land, perhaps different techniques are used on the other side, so exciting this is. Your rituals have narrowed down the location of the artifacts you need, and your overseers have decided that a massive form of the ritual must be enacted. Under the watch of your superior \cNobleOne{\intro} and base security, the ritual was put into motion, with the rather unwanted help of \cMageOne{}. 

There was a flash, a sense of wrongness, and a taste of red. There are a number of other people in strange attire. One looks so strangely like your twin, and the walls, they are no longer just the simple stone you are used to but a mix of stone and metal, and your ritual station now has an odd metal mirror of itself on the other side of the room. The ritual seems to have taken the your base and blended it with a base on the otherside. The world is one parallel to yours to the point that there are even doubles of yourselves there. It seems their side mirrors your situation and their attempted to come to your side seeking three artifacts that you know are on base somewhere. 

You and your rival will need to work with these newcomers to create something to analyze the artifacts in question to see how they can stabilize the worlds. Of course any plans will need to be signed off on by \cNobleOne{} before any building is allowed, bureaucracy at its finest. Also fortunate is that while the rest of both worlds are cut off at the moment, \cPaladin{} is here, meaning your mana will be able to be recharged, thank the gods.

On the thought of the doubles, you recognize \cRogueTwo{\intro} as your \cRogueTwo{\parent} so it is quite possible that they have a double as well, which mean you have a second chance to have a \cRogueTwo{\parent}, one that is not a worthless walkout.

%% The typesetting is very tight, and matches that used by the lists
%% at the end of character sheets.  It takes an optional argument that
%% acts as a title for the list.  The enum environment is a similar
%% variation of the enumerate environment, and the desc environment is
%% similar to description.
