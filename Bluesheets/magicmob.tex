\bigquote{``The Golden Rule: Those who have the gold, rule''}

You are a member of \bMagicMob{}. This proud organization has long worked from the shadows to build itself up as a subtle but undeniable influence at all levels of \bMagicWorld{} society. Harking from a time when self righteous fools believed they could force their beliefs on consumption onto the rest of society. While quick money brought quick power, those who brought all the criminals together, with blood in some cases, were wise enough to keep excesses to a minimum. The law may be on the lookout for what they can, but in truth the leaders of \bMagicMob{} have been wise enough to spend their wealth in forging connections throughout society deeply enough that being uprooted is impossible. You are simple proof that the fingers of \bMagicMob{} dip into the highest of secrets. Our name is feared, whispered in the night, we are those that have not mercy for the other, the outsider. Oddly enough wee have through connections, found another version of ourselves on the otherside. Now to make a profit from this. Take care lest the other group while given incentive to work with you, betrays you. You have your assignments given individually. That is the way so that even under the harshest of enemy interrogation a sibling will not betray. You are allowed to share you mission to other members if necessary, and only if necessary.

Given that everything got kind of thrown around in this convergence, you'd better make sure you find your box before the \bTechMob{} does. 

\begin{itemz}[Goals]
	\item Find out the members of the otherside's group
	\item Make the drug exchange. Your drugs are denoted by item number \iDrugsMagic{}.
	\item Do not get caught, if caught your outside connections can only help after the event is done
\end{itemz}
