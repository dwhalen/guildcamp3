The world you grew up in stands on the shoulders of giants. Thousands of years of technological and scientific advancement have created a society where machines and medicine make a comfortable life possible for anyone who can afford them. Sparkling cities with cloud-piercing skyscrapers dot your continents, interspersed with plains fruited with the bounty of optimally enhanced crops, hydroponic centers, and factories where cruelty-free meat is grown in vats. Animals raised for their eggs and milk live out their lives in comfort on the tiered green towers that dot the rural areas. Pollution is all but a thing of the past. Your technological predecessors relied on such technology to build up your nations, but in time new technologies made such things obsolete and made it possible to clean the land and air of the pollutants that had been previously released. Your people have even managed to colonize your planet's moon and are ever-expanding towards the stars.

A few decades ago, it became possible to enhance the DNA of zygotes early in a pregnancy to ensure that the potential child would be healthy and intelligent. Now, a few generations later, most citizens have gone through enhancement in the womb, giving them the best chance at success in society. There are some among the poorer classes that cannot afford enhancement for their children, but such children still play a part in society, filling supportive roles to those with a higher potential for innovation and success. Technically it would be possible for an unenhanced citizen to attain a high-level role, but as they are in competition for jobs and school positions with citizens whose intelligence and skills have been genetically enhanced, this is fairly rare, and some would disapprove of the appointment of the unenhanced when there are those who were literally born for such roles.

In your society, the highest virtues are intelligence, innovation, technological skill, wit, and ability to perform one's role well. The lowest vices are, conversely, stupidity, willful ignorance, dullness, lack of technological skill, and failure to perform well in one's role. A high value is placed on striving for perfection. It is accepted that true perfection is impossible, but it is unseemly to make plain one's failures or to rub imperfection in other people's faces. For this reason, those who either willfully stray from the mold by not curing their disabilities or cannot afford the procedure are generally looked upon with distaste. A successful society requires all to strive for perfection and promote community through conforming to the highest standard. A disability is considered any condition that will disallow a person from integrating fully with society or will prevent them from optimal performance in their role. Particularly distrusted are those with disorders of the transient mind, who experience uncontrollable trances during which they cannot work and are unreachable for communication with their peers.
