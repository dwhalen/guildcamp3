%% Notebooks live in this directory.  There are two kinds: in-game
%% notebooks (like classic research notebooks) and out-of-game
%% notebooks (also known as green notebooks).  Both kinds are defined
%% in Lists/notebook-LIST.tex.  In-game notebooks, defined as Notebook
%% macros, get assigned in \MYitems.  Out-of-game notebooks, defined
%% as GreenNotebook macros, get assigned in \MYgreens.
%%
%% This file doubles as a latex'able example out-of-game notebook.
%% README.tex, also in this directory, doubles as an example in-game
%% notebook.
%%
%% Notebook and GreenNotebook macros each have a file that lives here.
%% The argument to \startnotebook{...}  probably should be the macro
%% for the given notebook.  However, you can also just use
%% \startnotebook{Some Text} if you want.
%%
%% Note that every \startnotebook command needs a matching
%% \endnotebook command.  Also note that no ownership information
%% appears on the notebook.
%%
%%
%% If you want to use notebooks for memory packets, see related macros
%% in Lists/mem-LIST.tex (and in Charsheets/README.tex).  If you want
%% more programmatic control over the structure/linkage of notebooks,
%% like for a computer security mechanic, see LabelCover and LabelPage
%% in Lists/sign-LIST.tex.

\startnotebook{\nEscapePodMagic{}}

% this belongs to rogue 1 and can hold only one person
% final parts needed: sheet of scrap metal, belladonna syrup, stardust, dragon skin, unicorn hoof, werewolf fang, and holy water

%% The argument to \begin{page}{...} is a reference string.  You use
%% \nbref{...} in page text to refer to a given page.  These
%% references will be typeset as numbers, based on the order of the
%% pages.
\begin{page}{first}

Well, given that your double is apparently worthless enough to have gotten removed from the other universe you certainly don't want to end up \emph{there}. Who knows if it's even worth living in your own world? Regardless, you aren't so certain those mages know how to save the world or anything so you'd best take matters into your own hands. You've read about a way to escape to another world entirely, maybe that'd be for the best. Do you care if other people know you want to escape? Probably not - not like anyone cares about you anyway.

Complete this notebook to come up with such a way. 

Get together 3 people who know how to juggle.  Then get 9 juggling
balls.  Have each juggler juggle three at once, such that all 9 are
being juggled at the same time.

If the group can go 1 minute or more without dropping a single ball,
go to step \nbref{1min}.  If they can go for 5 minutes without dropping
a single ball, go to step \nbref{good}.

\end{page}



%% the optional argument [One Minute] means this page will be labeled and
%% referenced with a string instead of a number.  The numbering of other
%% pages will ignore this one.
\begin{page}[One Minute]{1min}

blah you need to juggle better.

\end{page}



\begin{page}{nothing}

blah

\end{page}



\begin{page}{good}

blah not bad.  Continue for another 5 minutes, and you can go to step
\nbref{last}.

\end{page}



\begin{page}{last}

Your escape pod is created. It's a small pod, only big enough for you. If you want to escape to a random third universe, then sign your name below and ensure you have at least two units of $\alpha$ at game time T+4:00. 

Name:............................................................
