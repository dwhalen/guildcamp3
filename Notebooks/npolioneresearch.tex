You need to give your speech at 1 hour game time. Once done turn to the \nbref{PoliOneResearchSecond}
	
\end{page}

\begin{page}{PoliOneResearchSecond}
	
Next you need to study a \iMagnet{} for 13 minutes. Once done turn to the \nbref{PoliOneResearchThird}

	
\end{page}

\begin{page}{PoliOneResearchThird}
	
Now study a \iCentrifuge{} for 6 minutes. Once done turn to the \nbref{PoliOneResearchFourth}
	
\end{page}

\begin{page}{PoliOneResearchFourth}
	
	Things are making more sense now. You need to go study a \iLeadPipe{} for 9 minutes. Then turn to \nbref{PoliOneResearchFifth}
	
\end{page}

\begin{page}{PoliOneResearchFifth}
	
	Getting closer, next you need to study \iScrapMetal{} for 10 minutes, afterward turn to  \nbref{PoliOneResearchSixth}
	
\end{page}

\begin{page}{PoliOneResearchSixth}
	
	 Got to go find a \iSieve{} and study it for 4 minutes, then turn to  \nbref{PoliOneResearchSeventh}
	
\end{page}

\begin{page}{PoliOneResearchSeventh}
	
	So close you can almost taste the breakthrough, though no licking you next item of study the \iMonoBlade{}, this will take 6 minutes then turn to  \nbref{PoliOneResearchEighth}
	
\end{page}

\begin{page}{PoliOneResearchEighth}
	
	 You have it, you need to go to your \sTechWorkbench{} with the following items: 3 \iTFResistor{}s, \iScrapMetal{}, \iCog{}, \iCircuitBoard{}, \iFlashlight{}, \iMultitool{}. Then work on them for 5 minutes, once this has happened, consuming items that are labeled consume on use, turn to \nbref{PoliOneResearchNineth}.
	
\end{page}

\begin{page}{PoliOneResearchNineth}
	
	You have it, you now have a {$\omega$}={2}
