Just because you were not able to get that little pathetic piece of paper saying you are qualified, does not mean you are incapable of research. You have some of your own research to finish, the work of years that seems to be so close to a breakthrough. Just do not let the scientists stop you or catch you.  

To study an item hold or touch it openly treating it as though it were one hand more bulky than it is. 

First you need to get a hold of a \iCircuitBoard{} and study it for 5 minutes, this does not consume the item. Once done turn to \nbref{TechWorldSaveSecond}
	
\end{page}

\begin{page}{TechWorldSaveSecond}
	
Next you need to get a hold of a \iMagnet{} for and leave it next to your \sTechWorkbench{} for 10 minutes for calibrations to be run, you do not need to stay there while it is being measured. Once done turn to \nbref{TechWorldSaveThird}

	
\end{page}

\begin{page}{TechWorldSaveThird}
	
Now get a \iLeadPipe{} and measure the magnetic resonance with the \iMagnet{} for 30 seconds uninterrupted. Once done turn to \nbref{TechWorldSaveFourth}
	
\end{page}

\begin{page}{TechWorldSaveFourth}
	
	Things are making more sense now. You need to go grab a piece of \iScrapMetal{}, there should be plenty around, and take it back to your \sTechWorkbench{}. Then turn to \nbref{TechWorldSaveFifth}
	
\end{page}

\begin{page}{TechWorldSaveFifth}
	
	Getting closer, next you need to grab a \iMonoBlade{} to take samples from the \iScrapMetal{} at your \sTechWorkbench{}, though not enough to consume the \iScrapMetal{}, the process will take 1 minute  afterward turn to  \nbref{TechWorldSaveSixth}
	
\end{page}

\begin{page}{TechWorldSaveSixth}
	
	 Got to go find a  \iSieve{} to help filter your scrapings, this will take 3 minutes at your \sTechWorkbench{}, then turn to  \nbref{TechWorldSaveSeventh}
	
\end{page}

\begin{page}{TechWorldSaveSeventh}
	
	So close you can almost taste the breakthrough, now you just need a \iCentrifuge{} to separate your samples out, this will take 12 minutes as long as no body moves the \iCentrifuge{} you do not need to be present. Then turn to  \nbref{TechWorldSaveEighth}
	
\end{page}

\begin{page}{TechWorldSaveEighth}
	
	 You have it, you need to go to your \sTechWorkbench{} with the following items: 3 \iTFResistor{}s, \iScrapMetal{}, \iCog{}, \iCircuitBoard{}, \iFlashlight{}, \iMultitool{}. Then work on them for 5 minutes, once this has happened, consuming items that are labeled consume on use, turn to \nbref{TechWorldSaveNineth}.
	
\end{page}

\begin{page}{TechWorldSaveNineth}
	
	You have it, it works, and you have a slight headache as ideas, concepts never thought of run through your mind. You have a way to save both worlds.  You must gather 3 pairs of doubles and all get together and hold hands in a circle with each of you across from your double. You must remain this way for at least 3 minutes and must be in position at game end (T+4:00).
