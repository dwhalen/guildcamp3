Just because you were not able to get that little pathetic piece of paper saying you are qualified, does not mean you are incapable of research. You have some of your own research to finish, the work of years that seems to be so close to a breakthrough. Just do not let the scientists stop you or catch you.  

To study an item hold or touch it openly treating it as though it were one hand more bulky than it is. 

First you need to get a hold of a \iDiamondDrill{} and study it for 7 minutes. Once done turn to \nbref{TechWorldSaveSecond}
	
\end{page}

\begin{page}{TechWorldSaveSecond}
	
Next you need to study a \iMagnet{} for 13 minutes. Once done turn to \nbref{TechWorldSaveThird}

	
\end{page}

\begin{page}{TechWorldSaveThird}
	
Now study a \iCentrifuge{} for 6 minutes. Once done turn to \nbref{TechWorldSaveFourth}
	
\end{page}

\begin{page}{TechWorldSaveFourth}
	
	Things are making more sense now. You need to go study a \iLeadPipe{} for 9 minutes. Then turn to \nbref{TechWorldSaveFifth}
	
\end{page}

\begin{page}{TechWorldSaveFifth}
	
	Getting closer, next you need to study \iScrapMetal{} for 10 minutes, afterward turn to  \nbref{TechWorldSaveSixth}
	
\end{page}

\begin{page}{TechWorldSaveSixth}
	
	 Got to go find a \iSieve{} and study it for 4 minutes, then turn to  \nbref{TechWorldSaveSeventh}
	
\end{page}

\begin{page}{TechWorldSaveSeventh}
	
	So close you can almost taste the breakthrough, though no licking you next item of study the \iMonoBlade{}, this will take 6 minutes then turn to  \nbref{TechWorldSaveEighth}
	
\end{page}

\begin{page}{TechWorldSaveEighth}
	
	 You have it, you need to go to your \sTechWorkbench{} with the following items: 3 \iTFResistor{}s, \iScrapMetal{}, \iCog{}, \iCircuitBoard{}, \iFlashlight{}, \iMultitool{}. Then work on them for 5 minutes, once this has happened, consuming items that are labeled consume on use, turn to \nbref{TechWorldSaveNineth}.
	
\end{page}

\begin{page}{TechWorldSaveNineth}
	
	You have it, it works, and you have a slight headache as ideas, concepts never thought of run through your mind. You have a way to save both worlds.  You must gather 3 pairs of doubles and all get together and hold hands in a circle with each of you across from your double. You must remain this way for at least 3 minutes and must be in position at game end (T+4:00).
