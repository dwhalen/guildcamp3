	If you are receiving this greensheet, you are able to participate in the publishing race between the scientists somehow. There are several ways to participate in this race. The ultimate goal is to be the one who gets your name on the Official List of Good Experiments the most times. 
	
	The first way to get your name on the list is by putting the most components into the machine that the scientists and mages are building to generate the answers as to how to save the world.
	
	The second is by being the first to create various different objects. The objects you can create include:
	%\iHealthPotion{}\iHealthRemedy{}\iTranceCure{}\iInvisibilityCloak{}\iCloakingDevice{}\iTruthPotion{}\iTruthSerum{}\iMagicPoison{}\iTechPoison{}\iStrengthSpell{}\iSteroids{}\iCRUpPotion{}\iCRUpSerum{}\iCRDownPotion{}\iCRDownSerum{}\iKOSpell{}\iSonicKO{}\iMCSpell{}\iMCDevice{}\iUpgradedTechGun{}\iUpgradedMagicgun{}\iSmallEscapePod{}\iLargeEscapePod{}
