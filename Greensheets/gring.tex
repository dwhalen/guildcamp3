    Offering a Promise Ring
    According to the culture of your land, lovers can proclaim their affection by forging a promise ring and giving it to the beloved. Although this token does not imply marriage (actual proposals involve poetry), it nonetheless represents a serious emotional commitment.
    To offer a promise ring:
\begin{enum}[Directions]
      \item Obtain a promise ring. Otherwise, you can forge one from 2 sheets of scrap metal and 1 unit of stardust. You must manipulate the scrap metal at the paladin's altar for 5 minutes, after which the components will be consumed and replaced by a ring. This is an interruptible mechanic.
\item Once you have a ring, chant or sing to it for at least 30 seconds in order to obtain divine blessing. Infuse your voice with the passion of your love.
\item Get a physrep of the ring from a GM.
\item Present the ring to your beloved, while also declaring your beloved. If they accept, rejoice. Otherwise, keep the ring for yourself. You may wear it or destroy it, as you wish.
       \end{enum}
