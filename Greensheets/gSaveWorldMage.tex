%% Greensheets live in this directory.  This file doubles as a
%% latex'able example greensheet.
%%
%% _template.tex serves as a bare-bones template suitable for
%% copying when starting a new sheet.
%%
%% Greensheet macros (in ../Lists/green-LIST.tex, presumably) each
%% have a file that lives here.  The argument to \name{...} probably
%% should be the macro for the given greensheet, which will generate
%% the greensheet's name as specified in green-LIST.tex.  However, you
%% can also just use \name{Some Text} if you want.
