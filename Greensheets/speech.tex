	If you have this sheet then you are qualified to (and in fact mandated to) write and give a speech. You must give speeches at game time T+1:00 and T+3:00. These speeches are meant to rally together everyone in an effort to save the world. 
	
	At game time T+1:00, you should present on the plans to build the machine to determine the order of the artifacts. That means that the proposal should be finished prior. 
	
	
	At game time T+3:00, you should present on what you will do to save the world. After all, there's only one hour until T+4:00 when it will all end! Better reassure everyone. 
	
	For each speech, ensure as many people are present as possible. The majority of each faction should be present. Each politician or noble must present during at least one of the two scheduled speech times. 
	
	The structure of each one will be as follows:
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Have a 2 minute speech by one of the leaders from either \bMagicWorld{} or \bTechWorld{}
		\item Have a 2 minutes speech by the leader of the other of \bMagicWorld{} and \bTechWorld{}
		\item Have a 2 minute religious ceremony. This will probably be led by \cPaladin{}
	\end{enumerate}	
	
	\emph{Note: If it is not possible for a leader from one of \bMagicWorld{} or \bTechWorld{} to speak, they should provide an alternate ambassador.}
