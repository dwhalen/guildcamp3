If you have this greensheet, you know how to find the parts needed to run the machine in order to figure out the necessary artifact order. You know that there are three parts needed to produce the correct answer and that they consist of the following three categories:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Something representing humanity
	\item Something representing your mechanical and physical progress
	\item Something representing your electronic and computational progress
\end{enumerate}

In order to get the machine to spit out the correct answers you will have to determine which of those objects are needed. Maybe you'll find some inventorying what's still here. 

Once the machine is built and you have the parts, bring them to the machine. Set them in a triangular shape around the outside of the machine and keep them there for five minutes. This will consume four units of $\omega$. You may distribute them as you see fit amongst present PCs.

\emph{out of game: A GM should be present to check the output of the machine.}

% ans: blood plasma, a transistor, and graphene
