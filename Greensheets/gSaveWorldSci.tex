If you are receiving this greensheet, then you have are involved in the research on how to avoid the end of \bTechWorld{}. You have an outline for completing your research, but unfortunately your research will no longer be sufficient given the state of the convergence. You may even have to cooperate with the magical sciency folks present in order to complete the tasks. You are pretty certain you need to build a machine for this - the Geospatial Fusion Globemaster (GFG for short). 

% 1 circuit board
Item 1: A .. .. .. .. .. .. .. , .. .. .. .. ..

% 50 ohms of resistors
Item 2: .......... of .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..

% 3 sheets of scrap metal
Item 3: .. of .. .. .. .. ..  ,  .. .. .. .. ..

% 1 cog
Item 4: ........... of .. .. .. 

% 1steam turbine
Item 5: A .. .. .. .. ..  ,  .. .. .. .. .. ..

You will also need a \iMultitool{}, \iScrewdriver{}, and two magical items (cauldron, and plumbic rod) to complete the assembly. 


\begin{enum}[Directions]
	\item Determine the items needed to build the machine. You will need all of the technical items and all of the magical items. 
	\item Write these into the proposal whitesheet. 
	\item Get this proposal signed by the current highest represented official of both the Magic and the Tech world. Also, get it checked by a GM.
	\item Find all of the required items and bring them to the lab space in 200-002.
	\item Arrange all of the items on the table. With at least one scientist and one mage present, spend five minutes working on the items using the four assembly tools. This process consumes 7 units of $\alpha$ and 7 units of $\omega$. These units can come from anyone present. 
	\item After five minutes, the machine will be complete. Destroy items 1-5 from both the Magic and Technical Worlds. The machine is indestructible. You can now use it to input in items and retrieve orders for the artifacts.
