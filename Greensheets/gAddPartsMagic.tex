If you have this greensheet, you know how to find the parts needed to run the machine in order to figure out the necessary artifact order. You know that there are three parts needed to produce the correct answer and that they consist of the following three categories:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Something representing wonder
	\item Something representing faith
	\item Something representing strength
\end{enumerate}

In order to get the machine to spit out the correct answers you will have to determine which of those objects are needed. Maybe you'll find some inventorying what's still around. 

Once the machine is built and you have the parts, bring them to the machine. Set them in a triangular shape around the outside of the machine and keep them there for five minutes. 

\emph{out of game: A GM should be present to check the output of the machine.}

% ans: stardust, dragon skin, and holy water
