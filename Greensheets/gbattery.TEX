If you have this sheet, then you know how to charge batteries. There are two ways to charge batteries. One way is slower, but doesn't destroy any resources. The other is much faster and more powerful, but destroys weapons in the process. Only the technician can use the fast method. 


\begin{enum}[The slow, nondestructive way]
  \item Go to your work bench (room 200-032) with the battery that needs charged, a screwdriver, and a multitool.
  \item Spend 5 minutes working on the battery with the screwdriver and multitool.
  \item After 5 minutes, the battery regains one unit of charge.
  \item You can continue to charge the battery at the rate of one charge unit per 5 minutes. 
\end{enum}

\begin{enum}[The fast way which destroys weapons]
	\item Procure a weapon (magic or tech) and a multitool and the device you would like to charge.
	\item Spend 3 minutes working on the weapon. 
	\item If you are the technician, this extracts 3 units of charge that you can put into any available battery/batteries. 
	\item This now destroys the weapon (regardlessof whether you got any charge from it). Mark it as such. 
\end{enum}
