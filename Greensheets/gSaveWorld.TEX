As everyone here is aware, the end of the world is upon us. Both Magic and Tech have discovered this and in parallel attempts to save themselves have gathered here together today. Your world has discovered three large artifacts which are critical to ensuring your worlds safety. However, a total of three pairs of items are required. Once all six of these items are procured they must be paired correctly in the correct room at the correct time. At the world ending time, the universe will check on the configuration of the artifacts and determine what is going to happen.

\begin{enum}[Directions]
  \item Procure the six artifacts. Your world had three such artifacts.  
  \item Go to the dedicated assembly location (200-002)
  \item Assemble the artifacts in the correct set of pairs.
  \item Ensure the artifacts are assembled correctly at the world ending moment. 
\end{enum}
