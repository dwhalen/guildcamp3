	If you have this sheet then you are qualified to initiate the steps to get a leader from your side fired. This is only to be done in an emergency, when sufficient proof of wrong doing has been presented. Sufficient proof is allowable in the form of sheets labeled 'irrefutable proof' and in the case of truth telling potions and religious confessions provided there are three witnesses who verify the statement (for this purpose players may not lie). The only people who can be removed from their position are politicians and nobles.	
	
	
	\begin{enum}[Directions]
		\item If you have found proof that the leader has committed wrongdoing then proceed to the next step.
		\item You must gather the majority of your side's personnel in one place. This must happen at the beginning of one of the official speeches (at game time T+1:00 and T+3:00).
		\item You must present the proof of wrongdoing to the personnel mentioned.
		\item You must get a vote which includes at least 4 votes against the accused person, not including the accuser. If less than 4 members are still alive, then everyone present (except the accused) must vote to remove them. 
		\item If successful then the person is stripped of their rank and no longer has authority to give orders to personnel.
