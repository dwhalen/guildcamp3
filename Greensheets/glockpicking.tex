	Lockpicking:
	
	You may use this mechanic to gain access to locked safes, vaults, etc. It cannot let you into the Armory.
	In order to attempt lockpicking, you must possess a set of lock picks, which will be physrepped by a collection of five dice. More than one person may attempt to break the same lock simultaneously. Lockpicking is an interruptible mechanic.
	
	
	\begin{enum}[Directions]
		\item If the lock is labelled "Easy," re-roll all five dice until you receive at least two of a kind (e.g.- 1, 2, 3, 1, 4). If the lock is labelled "Medium," re-roll all five dice until you receive at least three of a kind (e.g.- 5, 5, 6, 5, 2). If the lock is labelled "Hard," re-roll all five dice until you receive a two of one kind and three of another (e.g.- 4, 2, 2, 2, 4).
		\item If you at any time roll five of a kind (e.g.- 3, 3, 3, 3, 3), you have botched your attempt at lock picking. It is now obvious to observers that someone has messed with the lock. Write "Evidence of Tampering With Lock" once on the page that lists the lock's difficulty.
