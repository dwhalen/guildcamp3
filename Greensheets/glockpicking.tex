	You may use this mechanic to gain access to locked safes, vaults, etc. It cannot get you into the Armory.
	In order to attempt lockpicking, you must possess a set of lock picks, which will be physrepped by a collection of five dice. More than one person may attempt to break the same lock simultaneously. Lockpicking is an interruptible mechanic; it is obvious to anyone who sees you that you are tampering with a lock.
	
	
	\begin{enum}[Directions]
		\item If the lock is labelled "Easy," re-roll all five dice until you receive three of a kind (e.g.- 1, 3, 3, 3, 4). If the lock is labelled "Medium," re-roll all five dice until you receive five different numbers (1, 4, 3, 5, 6). If the lock is labelled "Hard," re-roll all five dice until you receive a two of one kind and three of another (e.g.- 4, 2, 2, 2, 4).
		\item When preparing to re-roll dice, you must pick up the dice in consecutive order-- first the 1's, then the 2's, and so on.
		\item If you at any time roll four or five of a kind (e.g.- 3, 6, 3, 3, 3), you have botched your attempt at lock picking, and you cannot try to open this lock again for 5 minutes. It is also now obvious to observers that someone has messed with the lock. Write "Evidence of Tampering With Lock" once on the page that lists the lock's difficulty.
