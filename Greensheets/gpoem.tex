	Writing a Proposal Poem
	According to the culture of your land, proposals of marriage are offered through poems, written from a lover to the beloved.
\begin{enum}[Directions]
        \item Observe the object of your affection at length.
         \item Write them a lyrical poem that conveys the depth of your love, mentioning at least two specific characteristics of the beloved. You should also describe what you can offer them (money, fame, intelligent conversation, your undying love, etc.)
         \item To present the poem to your beloved, you must kneel before them and read it aloud to them. Typically, the reading occurs either in private or before a large crowd of witnesses.
        \item Conclude the reading by asking for the beloved's hand in marriage. If they accept, they must take the poem as a sign of your affection. If they reject you, take it to some private location and destroy it.
