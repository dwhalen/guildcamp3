	Here is a list of typical prices for the black market. These are prices you can expect to receive from your contacts back home after the game. You could also use them as guidelines when bartering with other players during game. They also are the values used when you have any requirements dictating you have items worth a certain amount of gold. If an item is not on this list, it does not count for any gold for that mechanic. You can still try to sell it to or buy it from other players.
