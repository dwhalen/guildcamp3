The interview with Santa had the following results:

Q:  Santa, why do you think you've grown to be the most famous man in the
entire world?  After all, there are plenty of people who are doing
good deeds....

Santa:	I think it's my red suit.  Red is most people's favorite color.

Q:  Every year at Christmas time, merchandisers all over the world use your
name, and your image to sell their goods.  Do you feel you're being
exploited?

Santa:	Not too much.  But last year I had a talk with the Easter Bunny, and
boy, is he ever ticked off!

Q:  What do you do for money, Santa?

Santa:	Well, I don't need much.  We get most of our food from our summer
garden.  And most of the materials for the toys are donated by good
people all over the world.
