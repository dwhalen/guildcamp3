%% _template.tex serves as a bare-bones template suitable for

%% Whitesheet macros (in ../Lists/white-LIST.tex, presumably) each
%% have a file that lives here.  The argument to \name{...} probably
%% should be the macro for the given whitesheet.  However, you can also
%% just use \name{Some Text} if you want.
%%
%% Note that for whitesheets, \name doesn't actualy typeset anything.
%% If you want the ``title'' of the IG document to appear, typeset it
%% how you want it.  Similarly, no ownership information appears on
%% the sheet.
%%
%% If the whitesheet has a number (via \MYnumber in
%% Lists/white-LIST.tex), \name{<white macro>} will cause the number
%% to printed as an out-of-game note.

\large\textbf{Proposal to Build the Save the World Machine}  

\oog{You must get this signed by \cNobleOne{\intro} and \cPoliOne{\intro} before the first speeches (game time 1 hour)}

This proposal details the necessary requirements for constructing a machine which will inform us of the proper order to construct the artifacts.
