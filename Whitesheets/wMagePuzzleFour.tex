%% Whitesheets live in this directory.  This file doubles as a
%% latex'able example whitesheet.
%%
%% _template.tex serves as a bare-bones template suitable for
%% copying when starting a new sheet.
%%
%% Whitesheet macros (in ../Lists/white-LIST.tex, presumably) each
%% have a file that lives here.  The argument to \name{...} probably
%% should be the macro for the given whitesheet.  However, you can also
%% just use \name{Some Text} if you want.
%%
%% Note that for whitesheets, \name doesn't actualy typeset anything.
%% If you want the ``title'' of the IG document to appear, typeset it
%% how you want it.  Similarly, no ownership information appears on
%% the sheet.
%%
%% If the whitesheet has a number (via \MYnumber in
%% Lists/white-LIST.tex), \name{<white macro>} will cause the number
%% to printed as an out-of-game note.

\large\textbf{Mage Puzzle for Ingredient Four}  

Well, this part of your spell book seems to have completely disappeared in the portal. There does however seem to be some sort of a decoder here. Assemble the decoder and consult with the scientists to figure out what this ingredient is. 

You'll only need one of this ingredient.
