 There was this little kid in grade 2 whose name was Johnny.
 He went to school with grade 2's. (!) Anyway, every Monday,
 after school the teacher would ask the student's in Johnny's
 class some trivia questions; if they answered the questions
 correctly, the teacher promised them that they wouldn't have
 to go to school for the rest of the week.
 One Monday, the teacher asked the students:
 'What is the chemical symbol for Potassium'
 Since the kids were only in gr. 2, they didn't even
 know what potassium was. The next Monday, the teacher asked:
 'In what year did Mt. St. Helen's first explode?'
 Of course, the students didn't answer. Johnny was
 getting kind of peeved with these kind of questions. The
 next Monday, Johnny brought a pair black squash balls
 to school with him. Just as the teacher was about to ask
 the weekly question, Johnny rolled the marbles toward the
 front of the room. The teacher, not seeing him, got agitated
 and said 'Alright, whose the comedian with the 2 black
 balls?'
 Johnny, just a-laughing answered 'Bill Cosby, See ya
 next week!'
